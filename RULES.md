# Matchmaze Rules

The game is for 2 to 4 players. Ages 5-ish and up, though it's fun for all (in
our experience)..

Set up:
 * The starting positions are the starred corners.
 * A game tile is a white space, possibly containing a portal.
 * The portals are the numbered squares and circles in the tiles.
 * All the tiles, except the starred start tiles, are covered in memory-matching
   cards.
 * The players put their pieces on the start positions.
 * The winner of the game is the first to make it to the start/finish star in
   opposite corner.
 * The person rolling the highest value on the die starts; if there is a tie then
   all players re-roll.

The goal of the game is to get to the opposing corner so, if you're playing with,
two players you have two choices: the players can either be in opposing corners,
making play more collaborative, or not, which makes it more combative. If playing
with three players the player opposite no-one is at a disadvantage and so it can
work better for their target corner to be one of the other players' ones.

Gameplay:
 * Play goes clockwise from player to player.
 * On their turn players first try to make a match. If a successful match uncovers
   a portal then the player should attempt to make another match.
 * After they are done making matches the player then rolls the die. A player must
   always move the number of spaces of their die roll, if they can. If they can't
   then they don't move.
 * A player may not traverse a tile covered by a memory card. They may pass over a
   tile with another player on it however.
 * If a player exactly lands on a second player then that first player must return
   to their starting corner star.
 * A player may move in any direction on a die roll but may not traverse the same
   tile square twice.
 * If a player lands on a portal then they roll the die to see which portal they
   teleport to, not including the one they are on. If multiple exit portals are
   available then they may choose from them. Only if all portals are blocked by a
   memory card, or by another player, they do not teleport.
 * If a player lands on a start/finish star which is not their own then it acts as
   an entry portal. They then roll again to see which portal they are teleported to.
 * A player must roll the exact number to finish on their exit square.
